# LeetCode_Python

I am currently looking for a job. During coding tests for several companies, I needed to use Python to complete the problems. Although I have been participating in programming competitions, I have always used C++ to solve problems. To quickly master the basics of Python, I intensively practiced by solving 100 questions on LeetCode. Through these exercises, I have essentially become proficient in Python’s commonly used syntax and data structures.
